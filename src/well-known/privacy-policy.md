## Privacy Policy for ChallengeBots Discord User Authentication Service
**Last Updated:** 2024-11-14
<br>Thank you for choosing ChallengeBots for your Discord User Authentication needs. Protecting your privacy is our top priority, and we are committed to ensuring that your data is secure and used only as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### 1. Information We Collect
ChallengeBots only collects the minimal information necessary to provide our service. The data we collect is as follows:

- **Discord Username**
- **Discord User Identification Number (ID)**
- **Discord Discriminator** (the 4-digit tag associated with your Discord username)
- **Discord Access Token**
- **Discord Avatar**
- **Discord Guild Information** (when using the dashboard function):
- Guild Identification Number (ID)
- Guild Name
- Guild Icon

### 2. Data Collection and Storage
All collected data is stored securely in an encrypted form. To enhance privacy and security, we employ the following methods:

### Multi-Layered Encryption:
- **User ID-Based Encryption:** All stored data is encrypted using the user’s Discord ID, ensuring that the information can only be accessed with the correct User ID.
- **Access Token-Based Encryption:** The data is further encrypted with the Discord Access Token, which is only stored by the user on their device, making it inaccessible to us.

- **Discord Access Token Storage:** The access token is only stored in encrypted form on the client device via a URL argument or a secure cookie.
- **Cookies:** An encrypted token containing your Discord User ID and Access Token may be stored as a cookie for authentication purposes.
- **Hashed User IDs:** User IDs are hashed before storage for added security.

No browser or client identification information is collected.

### 3. Data Security
To protect your data, we use industry-standard security measures, including:

- **Encryption:** All stored data is encrypted using the multi-layered encryption approach detailed above.
- **Access Control:** As data is encrypted with both the user’s ID and access token, access is limited to only the authorized user.

### 4. Data Retention
We retain your data only as long as needed to provide our services. If you no longer wish to use our service, you may request removal of your data. To do so, please complete the [User Removal Form](https://challengebots.tn3w.dev/removal). Upon submission, your data will be securely deleted from our system.
